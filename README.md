# **Note:** This will probably be the most shittest code you've ever seen, but it holds a special place in my heart as it was my very first private programming project.

# Study Planner

The Study Planner is, as the name suggests, a planner that is well-suited for university. It allows you to enter your university courses and display your timetable or upcoming events. Additionally, you can create your own to-do lists.

### Features

1. **Homepage**
   - Displays the next meeting with all the details about the event.
   - Also shows the subsequent meeting.
   - The bottom section contains a to-do list that is synchronized with the "TO-DO" page. If a new item with the same name is added there, it gets updated here.

2. **Add Page ("Hinzuf√ºgen")**
   - Allows you to add new events.
   - Existing events can be edited or deleted.

3. **Timetable Page ("Stundenplan")**
   - Based on the added events, you can view your timetable here.

4. **TO-DO Page**
   - Provides an overview of tasks for each event.
   - Helps to stay organized during your studies.

While it may not be perfect, this project holds sentimental value as it marks the beginning of my journey into programming.
